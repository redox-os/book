# Chat
The quickest and most open way to communicate with the Redox team is on our chat server. Currently, the only way to join it is by sending an email to [info@redox-os.org](mailto:info@redox-os.org), which might take a little while, since it's not automated. We're currently working on an easier way to do this, but this is the most convenient way right now.
