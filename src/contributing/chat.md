Chat
====

The quickest and most open way to communicate with the Redox team is on our chat server, powered with [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/).
Currently, the only way to join it is by sending an email to [info@redox-os.org](mailto:info@redox-os.org), which might take a little while, since it's not automated. We're currently working on an easier way to do this, but this is the most convenient way right now.

The Redox team is also available on IRC, on the `#redox` and `#rust` channels, but be advertised that we are less present on IRC than the Chat.
