# Getting started

Redox is still at experimental/alpha stage, but there are many things that you can do with it, and it's fun to try it out. You can start by downloading and running the latest release. Read the instructions for [running in a virtual machine](./running-vm.md) or [running on real hardware](./real-hardware.md).

The [Building Redox](./podman-build.md) page has information about configuring your system to build Redox, which is necessary if you want to contribute to the development. The [Advanced Podman Build](./advanced-podman-build.md) page gives a look under the hood of the build process to help you maintain your build environment.

By reading [this](./build-system-reference.md) page you can have a complete understanding of the build system.
