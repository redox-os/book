# Podman Build

To make the Redox build process more consistent across platforms, we are using **Rootless Podman** for major parts of the build. **Podman** is invoked automatically and transparently within the Makefiles.

The TL;DR version is [here](#tldr---new-or-existing-working-directory).

You can find out more about Podman [here](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Introduction.html).

## Disabling Podman Build

By default, Podman Build is disabled. The variable `PODMAN_BUILD` in `mk/config.mk` defaults to zero, so that **Podman** will not be invoked. If you find that it is enabled but you want it disabled, set `PODMAN_BUILD?=0` in `mk/config.mk`, and ensure it is not set in your environment, `unset PODMAN_BUILD`.

## Podman Build Overview

**Podman** is a *virtual machine manager* that creates *containers* to execute a virtual machine *image*. In our case, we are creating an **Ubuntu** image, with a **Rust** installation and all the packages needed to build the system.

The build process is performed in your normal working directory, e.g. `~/tryredox/redox`. Compilation of the Redox components is performed in the container, but the final Redox image (`build/$ARCH/$CONFIG/harddrive.img` or `build/$ARCH/$CONFIG/livedisk.iso`) is constructed using [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) running directly on your host machine.

Setting `PODMAN_BUILD` to 1 in `mk/config.mk`, on the `make` command line (e.g. `make PODMAN_BUILD=1 all`) or in the environment (e.g. `export PODMAN_BUILD=1; make all`) will cause **Podman** to be invoked when building.

First, a **base image** called `redox_base` will be constructed, with all the necessary packages for the build. A "home" directory will also be created in `build/podman`. This is the home directory of your container alter ego, `poduser`. It will contain the `rustup` install, and the `.bashrc`. This takes some time, but is only done when necessary. The *tag* file [build/container.tag](#buildcontainertag) is also created at this time to prevent unnecessary image builds.

Then, various `make` commands are executed in **containers** built from the **base image**. The files are constructed in your working directory tree, just as they would for a non-Podman build. In fact, if all necessary packages are installed on your host system, you can switch Podman on and off relatively seamlessly, although there is no benefit to doing so.

The build process is using **Podman**'s `keep-id` feature, which allows your regular User ID to be mapped to `poduser` in the container. The first time a container is built, it takes some time to set up this mapping. After the first container is built, new containers can be built almost instantly.

### NOTES

- Envionment and Command Line Variables, other than ARCH, CONFIG_NAME and FILESYSTEM_CONFIG, are not passed to the part of `make` that is done in **Podman**. You must set any other config variables in `mk/config.mk` and not on the command line or in your environment.

- If you are building your own software to include in Redox, and you need to install additional packages using `apt-get` for the build, follow [Adding Packages to the Build](#adding-packages-to-the-build).

## TL;DR - [New](#new-working-directory) or [Existing](#existing-working-directory) Working Directory

### New Working Directory 

If you have already read the [Building Redox](./ch02-05-building-redox.html) instructions, but you wish to use **Podman Build**, follow these steps.

- Make sure you have the `curl` command. E.g. for Pop!_OS/Ubuntu/Debian:
```sh
which curl || sudo apt-get install curl 
```
- Make a directory, get a copy of `podman_bootstrap.sh` and run it. This will clone the repository and install **Podman**.
```sh
mkdir -p ~/tryredox
cd ~/tryredox
curl -sf https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/raw/master/podman_bootstrap.sh -o podman_bootstrap.sh
time bash -e podman_bootstrap.sh
```
- Change to the `redox` directory.
```sh
cd ~/tryredox/redox
```
- Edit `mk/config.mk` and change `PODMAN_BUILD` to 1.
```sh
gedit mk/config.mk &
```
```
...
PODMAN_BUILD?=1
...
```
- Build the system. This will take some time.
```sh
time make all
```

### Existing Working Directory

If you already have the source tree, you can use these steps.

- Change to your working directory and get the updates to the build files.
```sh
cd ~/tryredox/redox
git fetch upstream master
git rebase upstream/master
```

- Install **Podman**. Many distros require additional packages. Check the [Minimum Installation](#minimum-installation) instructions to see what is needed for your distro. Or, run the following in your working directory:
```sh
./podman_bootstrap.sh -d
```

- Set `PODMAN_BUILD` to 1 and run `make`. The first container setup can take 15 minutes or more, but it is comparable in speed to native build after that.
```sh
export PODMAN_BUILD=1
make all
```

To ensure `PODMAN_BUILD` is properly set for future builds, edit `mk/config.mk` and change its value.
```sh
gedit mk/config.mk &
```
```
...
PODMAN_BUILD?=1
...
```

## Minimum Installation

Most of the packages required for the build are installed in the container as part of the build process. However, some packages need to be installed on the host computer. You may also need to install an emulator such as **QEMU**. This is done for you in `podman_bootstrap.sh`, but you can do a minimum install by following the instructions below.

### Pop!_OS

```sh
sudo apt-get install podman
```

### Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install podman curl git make libfuse-dev
```

### ArchLinux

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed git podman fuse
```

### Fedora

```sh
sudo dnf install podman
```

## build/container.tag

The building of the **image** is controlled by the *tag* file `build/container.tag`. If you run `make all` with `PODMAN_BUILD=1`, the file `build/container.tag` will be created after the image is built. This file tells `make` that it can skip updating the image after the first time.

Many targets in the Makefiles `mk/*.mk` include `build/container.tag` as a dependency. If the *tag* file is missing, building any of those targets may trigger an image to be created, which can take some time.

When you move to a new working directory, if you want to save a few minutes, and you are confident that your **image** is correct and your `poduser` home directory `build/podman/poduser` is valid, you can do
```sh
make container_touch
```
This will create the file `build/container.tag` without rebuilding the image. However, it will fail if the image does not exist. If it fails, just do a normal `make`, it will create the container when needed.

## Cleaning Up

To remove the **base image**, any lingering containers, `poduser`'s home directory, including the **Rust** install, and `build/container.tag`, use
```sh
make container_clean
```

To check that everything has been removed,
```sh
podman ps -a
podman images
```
will show any remaining images or containers. If you need to do further cleanup,
```
podman system reset
```
will remove **all** images and containers. You still may need to remove `build/container.tag` if you did not do `make container_clean`. 

In some rare instances, `poduser`'s home directory can have bad file permissions, and you may need to do 
```sh
sudo chown -R `id -un`:`id -gn` build/podman
```
where `` `id -un` `` is your User ID and `` `id -gn` `` is your effective Group ID. Be sure to `make container_clean` after that.

**Note:**
- `make clean` does **not** run `make container_clean` and will **not** remove the container image.
- If you already did `make container_clean`, doing `make clean` could trigger an image build and a Rust install in the container. It invokes `cargo clean` on various components, which it must run in a container, since the build is designed to not require **Cargo** on your host machine. If you have Cargo installed on the host and in your PATH, you can use `make PODMAN_BUILD=0 clean` to clean without building a container. 

## Debugging your Build Process

If you are developing your own components and wish to do one-time debugging to determine what package you are missing in the **Podman Build** environment, the following instructions can help. Note that your changes will not be persistent. After debugging, **you must** [Add your Packages to the Build](#adding-packages-to-the-build). With `PODMAN_BUILD=1`, run the command:
```sh
make container_shell
```

This will start a `bash` shell in the **Podman** container environment, as a normal user without `sudo` privilege. Within that environment, you can build the Redox components with:
```sh
make repo
```
or, if you need to change `ARCH` or `CONFIG_NAME`,
```sh
./build.sh -a ARCH -c CONFIG_NAME repo
```

If you need `root` privileges, while you are **still running** the above `bash` shell, go to a separate **Terminal** or **Console** window on the host and type:
```sh
podman ps
```

This will list all running containers. There should be only one, but if there is more than one, consider only the newest. In the last column of the display, the container will have a randomly generated name `ADJECTIVE_NOUN`, e.g. `boring_dickens`. Replace the word `CONTAINER` with that name and type:

```sh
podman exec --user=0 -it CONTAINER bash
```

You will then be running bash with `root` privilege in the container, and you can use `apt-get` or whatever tools you need, and it will affect the environment of the user-level `container_shell` above. Do not precede the commands with `sudo` as you are already `root`. And remember that you are in an **Ubuntu** instance.

**Note**: Your changes will not persist once both shells have been exited.

Type `exit` on both shells once you have determined how to solve your problem.

## Adding Packages to the Build

The default **Containerfile**, `podman/redox-base-containerfile`, imports all required packages for a normal Redox build.

However, you cannot easily add packages after the **base image** is created. You must add them to your own Containerfile. 

Copy `podman/redox-base-containerfile` and add to the list of packages in the initial `apt-get`.
```sh
cp podman/redox-base-containerfile podman/my-containerfile
gedit podman/my-containerfile &
```
```
...
        xxd \
        rsync \
        MY_PACKAGE \
...
```
Make sure you include the continuation character `\` at the end of each line except after the last package.


Then, edit `mk/config.mk`, and change the variable `CONTAINERFILE` to point to your Containerfile, e.g.
```
CONTAINERFILE?=podman/my-containerfile
```

If your Containerfile is newer than `build/container.tag`, a new **image** will be created. You can force the image to be rebuilt with `make container_clean`.

If you feel the need to have more than one image, you can change the variable `IMAGE_TAG` in `mk/podman.mk` to give the image a different name.

## Summary of Podman-related Make Targets, Variables and Podman Commands

- `PODMAN_BUILD`: If set to 1 in `mk/config.mk`, or in the environment, or on the `make` command line, much of the build process takes place in **Podman**.

- `CONTAINERFILE`: The name of the containerfile used to build the image. This file includes the `apt-get` command that installs all the necessary packages into the image. If you need to add packages to the build, edit your own containerfile and change this variable to point to it.

- `make build/container.tag`: If no container image has been built, build one. It's not necessary to do this, it will be done when needed.

- `make container_touch`: If a container image already exists and `poduser`'s home directory is valid, but there is no *tag* file, create the *tag* file so a new image is not built.

- `make container_clean`: Remove the container image, `poduser`'s home directory and the *tag* file.

- `make container_shell`: Start an interactive Podman `bash` shell in the same environment used by `make`; for debugging the `apt-get` commands used during image build.

- `make env`: Start an interactive `bash` shell with the `prefix` tools in your PATH. Automatically determines if this should be a Podman shell or a host shell, depending on the value of `PODMAN_BUILD`.

- `make repo` or `./build.sh -a ARCH -c CONFIG repo`: Used while in a Podman shell to build all the Redox component packages. `make all` will not complete successfully, since part of the build process must take place on the host.

- `podman exec --user=0 -it CONTAINER bash`: Use this command in combination with `make container_shell` or `make env` to get `root` access to the Podman build environment, so you can temporarily add packages to the environment. `CONTAINER` is the name of the active container as shown by `podman ps`. For temporary, debugging purposes only.

- `podman system reset`: Use this command when `make container_clean` is not sufficient to solve problems caused by errors in the container image. It will remove all images, use with caution. If you are using **Podman** for any other purpose, those images will be deleted as well.

## Gory Details

If you are interested in how we are able to use your working directory for builds in **Podman**, the following configuration details may be interesting.

We are using **Rootless Podman**'s `--userns keep-id` feature. Because Podman is being run Rootless, the *container's* `root` user is actually mapped to your User ID on the host. Without the `keep-id` option, a regular user in the container maps to a phantom user outside the container. With the `keep-id` option, a user in the container that has the same User ID as your host User ID, will have the same permissions as you.

During the creation of the **base image**, Podman invokes **Buildah** to build the image. Buildah does not allow User IDs to be shared between the host and the container in the same way that Podman does. So the base image is created without `keep-id`, then the first container created from the image, having `keep-id` enabled, triggers a remapping. Once that remapping is done, it is reused for each subsequent container.

The working directory is made available in the container by **mounting** it as a **volume**. The **Podman** option 
```
--volume "`pwd`":$(CONTAINER_WORKDIR):Z
```
takes the directory that `make` was started in as the host working directory, and **mounts** it at the location `$CONTAINER_WORKDIR`, normally set to `/mnt/redox`. The `:Z` at the end of the name indicates that the mounted directory should not be shared between simultaneous container instances. It is optional on some Linux distros, and not optional on others.

For our invocation of Podman, we set the PATH environment variable as an option to `podman run`. This is to avoid the need for our `make` command to run `.bashrc`, which would add extra complexity. The `ARCH`, `CONFIG_NAME` and `FILESYSTEM_CONFIG` variables are passed in the environment to allow you to override the values in `mk/config.mk`, e.g. by setting them on your `make` command line or by using `build.sh`.

We also set `PODMAN_BUILD=0` in the environment, to ensure that the instance of `make` running in the container knows not to invoke **Podman**. This overrides the value set in `mk/config.mk`.

In the **Containerfile**, we use as few `RUN` commands as possible, as **Podman** commits the image after each command. And we avoid using `ENTRYPOINT` to allow us to specify the `podman run` command as a list of arguments, rather than just a string to be processed by the entrypoint shell.

Containers in our build process are run with `--rm` to ensure the container is discarded after each use. This prevents a proliferation of used containers. However, when you use `make container_clean`, you may notice multiple items being deleted. These are the partial images created as each `RUN` command is executed while building.

Container images and container data is normally stored in the directory `$HOME/.local/share/containers/storage`. The command
```sh
podman system reset
```
removes that directory in its entirety. However, the contents of any **volume** are left alone.
