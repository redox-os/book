Welcome!
========

This is the **Redox OS** book, which will go through (almost) everything about Redox: design, philosophy, how it works, how you can contribute, how to deploy Redox, and much more.

*Please note that this book is a work in progress.*

If you want to skip straight to trying out Redox, see [Getting started](./ch02-01-getting-started.html).
