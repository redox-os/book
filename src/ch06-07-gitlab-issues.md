# GitLab Issues

GitLab issues are a somewhat formal way to communicate with fellow Redox devs, but a little less quick and convenient than the chat. Issues are a good way to discuss specific topics, but if you want a quick response, using the chat is probably better.

If you haven't requested to join the chat yet, you should (if at all interested in contributing)!
