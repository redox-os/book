Coreutils
=========

Coreutils is a collection of basic command line utilities included with Redox (or with Linux, BSD, etc.). This includes programs like `ls`, `cp`, `cat` and various other tools necessary for basic command line interaction.

Redox's coreutils aim to be more minimal than, for instance, the GNU coreutils included with most Linux systems.
