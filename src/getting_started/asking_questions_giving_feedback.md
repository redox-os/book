Asking questions, giving feedback, or anything else
===================================================

The quickest and most open way to **communicate with the Redox team** is on our **chat server**. Currently, you can only get an invite by sending an email request to [info@redox-os.org](mailto:info@redox-os.org), which might take a little while, since it's not automated. Simply say you'd like to join the chat. We're working on an better way to do this, but this is the best way right now.

Alternatively you can use [our Forum].
