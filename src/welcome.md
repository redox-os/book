Welcome!

This is the Redox book, which will go through (almost) everything about Redox: design, philosophy, how it works, how you can contribute, how to deploy Redox, and much more.

*Please note that this book is currently being (re)written.*

If you want to skip straight to trying out Redox, see [Getting started](getting_started/getting_started.html).
