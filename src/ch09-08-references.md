### Ideas

- [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) - The Linux kernel contain lots of ideas that improved the Unix design (POSIX) and system engineering.
- [Android](https://developer.android.com/) - Android created many ideas to improve the system security and power efficiency.

### Manual Pages

- [FreeBSD Manual Pages](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi) - Powerful source for Unix/BSD documentation.

- [Linux Manual Pages (die.net)](https://linux.die.net/man/) - Another popular source for Linux documentation.

### Source Code

If you want to implement something (drivers, hardware interfaces, fix bugs, etc) but the documentation is not good or not available, you can verify the implementation of other operating systems.
