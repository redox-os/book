# Our Philosophy

Redox OS is predominately MIT X11-style licensed, including all software, documentation, and fonts. There are only a few exceptions to this, which are all licensed under other compatible open source licenses.

The MIT X11-style license has the following properties:
- It gives you, the user of the software, complete and unrestrained access to the software, such that you may *inspect*, *modify*, and *redistribute* your changes
  - *Inspection* Anyone may inspect the software for security vulnerabilities
  - *Modification* Anyone may modify the software to fix security vulnerabilities
  - *Redistribution* Anyone may redistribute the software to patch the security vulnerabilities
- It is compatible with GPL licenses - Projects licensed as GPL can be distributed with Redox OS
- It allows for the incorporation of GPL-incompatible free software, such as OpenZFS, which is CDDL licensed

The license does not restrict the software that may run on Redox, however -- and thanks to the microkernel architecture, even traditionally tightly-coupled components such as drivers can be distributed separately, so maintainers are free to choose whatever license they like for their projects.
