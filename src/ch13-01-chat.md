# Chat

The best way to communicate with the Redox team is on Matrix Chat. You can open the [Redox Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#redox:matrix.org) and see the rooms that are available (if you was accepted on the space, because only space members can see all rooms), these rooms are English-only, we don't accept other languages because we don't understand them.

Matrix has several different clients. [Element](https://element.io/) is a commonly used choice, it works on web browsers, Linux, MacOSX, Windows, Android and iOS.

- We follow the [Rust Code Of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) as rules of the chat rooms.

All rooms available on the Redox space:

- [#redox-join:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-join:matrix.org) - A room to be invited to Redox space.
