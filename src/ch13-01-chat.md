# Chat

The best way to communicate with the Redox team is on Matrix Chat. The [Redox Support Room](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-support:matrix.org) is open and does not require a password, and is the best place to get help with building, installing and running Redox. [Redox OS/Dev](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-dev:matrix.org) is for those that wish to contribute to Redox, or who want deeper technical assistance with developing on Redox. There is also [Redox OS/General](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-general:matrix.org) for general discussions about our use of Matrix and other non-technical topics. There may be additional Redox rooms on Matrix, but some of them may not be official, so connect with us on Redox OS/General before joining other rooms.

Until recently, we have been using a [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.org/) chat server, which we are currently maintaining for historical purposes. Currently, the only way to join it is by sending an email to [info@redox-os.org](mailto:info@redox-os.org), which might take a little while, since it's not automated. Contact us on Redox OS/General before doing this.
