# Chat

The best way to communicate with the Redox team is on Matrix Chat. You can join the [Redox Space](https://matrix.to/#/#redox:matrix.org) and see the  rooms that are available.

Matrix has several different clients. [Element](https://element.io/) is a commonly used choice.

We follow the [Rust Code Of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) as rules of the chat rooms.

If you don't joined the Redox Space, these are the rooms available:

- [#redox-general:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-general:matrix.org) - room for Redox-related discussions (questions, suggestions, porting, etc).
- [#redox-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-dev:matrix.org) - room for Redox development, here you can talk about anything development-related (code, proposals, achievements, styling, bugs, etc).
- [#redox-support:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-support:matrix.org) - room for Redox testing/building support (problems, errors, questions).
- [#redox-mrs:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-mrs:matrix.org) - room to cover all ready merge requests without conflicts  (if you have a ready MR to merge, send there).
- [#redox-board:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-board:matrix.org) - room for Redox Board of Directors meetings.
- [#redox-voip:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-voip:matrix.org)
- [#redox-random:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#redox-random:matrix.org) - room for off-topic.

Until recently, we have been using a [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.org/) chat server, which we are currently maintaining for historical purposes. Contact us on Redox OS/General if you need access to the Mattermost server.
