# Important Programs

This page covers important programs and libraries supported by Redox.

Redox is designed to be source-compatible with most Unix, Linux and POSIX-compliant applications, only requiring compilation.

Currently, most GUI applications require porting, as we don't support X11 or Wayland yet.

Some important software that Redox supports:

- GCC
- LLVM
- FFMPEG
- OpenSSL
- Mesa3D
- SDL2
- Git
- RustPython
- GNU Bash

You can see all Redox components and ported programs [here](https://static.redox-os.org/pkg/x86_64-unknown-redox/).
