Getting started
===============

[Preparing the build](ch02-04-preparing-the-build.md) has information about setting up your system to compile Redox, which is necessary if you want to contribute to Redox development.

If you aren't (currently) interested in going through the trouble of building Redox, you can download the latest release. See the instructions for [running in a virtual machine](ch02-02-try-vm.md) or [running on real hardware](ch02-03-real-hardware.md).
