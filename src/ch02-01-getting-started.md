Getting started
===============

[Preparing the build](ch02-04-preparing-the-build.html) and [Compiling Redox](./ch02-05-compiling-redox.html) have information about setting up your system to compile Redox, which is necessary if you want to contribute to Redox development.

If you aren't yet interested in spending the time to build Redox, you can download the latest release. See the instructions for [running in a virtual machine](ch02-02-try-vm.html) or [running on real hardware](ch02-03-real-hardware.html).
