# GitLab Issues

GitLab issues are a somewhat formal way to communicate with fellow Redox developers, but better for problems that cannot be quickly resolved. Issues are a good way to discuss specific features in detail or file bug reports, but if you want a quick response, using the chat is probably better.

If you haven't joined the chat yet, you should (if at all interested in contributing)!

Please follow the [Guidelines](./ch12-03-creating-proper-bug-reports.md) for your issues, if applicable. You will need a Redox GitLab account. See [Signing in to GitLab](./ch12-01-signing-in-to-gitlab.md).
