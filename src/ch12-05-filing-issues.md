# GitLab Issues

GitLab issues are a formal way to communicate with Redox developers. They are best used to document and discuss specific features or to provide detailed bug reports. This communication is preserved and available for later reference.

For problems that can be quickly resolved, or require a quick response, using the [chat](./ch13-01-chat.md) is probably better.

Once you create an issue don't forget to post the link on the Dev or Support rooms of the chat, because the GitLab email notifications have distractions (service messages or spam) and most developers don't left their GitLab pages open to receive desktop notifications from the web browser (which require a custom setting to receive issue notifications).

By doing this you help us to pay attention to your issues and avoid them to be accidentally forgotten.

If you haven't joined the chat yet, you should (if at all interested in contributing)!

Please follow the [Guidelines](./ch12-03-creating-proper-bug-reports.md) for your issues, if applicable. You will need a Redox GitLab account. See [Signing in to GitLab](./ch12-01-signing-in-to-gitlab.md).
