# GitLab Issues

GitLab issues are a formal way to communicate with Redox developers. They are best used to document and discuss specific features or to provide detailed bug reports. This communication is preserved and available for later reference.

For problems that can be quickly resolved, or require a quick response, using the [chat](./ch13-01-chat.md) is probably better.

When reporting a major bug or other important issue, please also post a message in [chat](./ch13-01-chat.md), so that it gets immediate attention.

If you haven't joined the chat yet, you should (if at all interested in contributing)!

Please follow the [Guidelines](./ch12-03-creating-proper-bug-reports.md) for your issues, if applicable. You will need a Redox GitLab account. See [Signing in to GitLab](./ch12-01-signing-in-to-gitlab.md).
