# Developing for Redox

Currently Redox does not have a complete set of development tools that run natively. You must do your development on Linux or other Unix-like system, then include or copy your program to your Redox filesystem. This chapter outlines some of the things you can do as a developer.

(Before reading this chapter you **must** read the [Build System](./ch08-06-build-system-reference.md) page)
